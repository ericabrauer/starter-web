Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether? It’s getting fucking old. To go partway is easy, but mastering anything requires hard fucking work. To surpass others is fucking tough, if you only do as you are told you don’t have it in you to succeed.
